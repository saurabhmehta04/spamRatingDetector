HAM,1.0,bad bussines because we thought a Mac is a good product
HAM,1.0,Very frustrating. Bought it after being pressured by salesman that it would work with windows docs that I use at work. When I complained to fellow teacher that I could not find files after I saved them,she commented that she could not always find her files either. She has an apple too.
SPAM,1.0,This laptop is simply amazing. It has a good hard drive with plent of menory and soace to do everything you want.
SPAM,1.0,All the sore employees were raving about these and saying these are trouble free and much better than a Windows PC. I get it home and it connects to the internet fine
HAM,1.0,First time Mac owner and wll never buy one again. THis computer is a piece of junk. For example,it will get stuck in 2 screen mode and not be able to recognize that I am not connected to another monitor and have my program displayed on the imaginary monitor. It will get bogged down and slow then the objects will scroll and drag with tracers. Every time I start from a shut down,many of my MS programs will be opened with blank files. I say many because it is often different every time. With facetime I forgot my password and there is not way to recover a new one. Files have disappeared,simple cutting and pasting of text has had issues at certain times. I am convinced that the 13.5 hard drives are not very robust and would not recommend that anyone buy these. It was expensive and there are numerous issues that I have never encountered in using computers for 10+ years.
HAM,1.0,Returned to store in three days never a Mc Book!! Hard to use video starts 
HAM,2.0,I got this mac to basically replace my larger macbookpro that is getting serviced. I expected it to be about the same as the mac I

HAM,2.0,Kind of disappointed...all the hype about apple is not justified based on my experience.
HAM,3.0,Good computer but takes learning a completely new format
Operation is very clean transition and speedy
SPAM,3.0,Great product. Bought opened box. Was not told from the hard reset some standard apps would not be on the laptop anymore. Lost iPhoto and iMovie. Called the store and I was told I would have to buy the apps again from apple. Would be nice to know this upfront.
HAM,3.0,As a first time Apple owner I find this product to be less user friendly than I was lead to believe. While it is a great computer I feel that it is overpriced and lacks the user friendly aspects that it promises
HAM,3.0,Recently bought the mac pro 4 G wanting to up grade to 8 G. I was not told the upgrade was not compadible with the apple mac. My apple mac pro kept locking up and making noises. I would have to manually shut it down to clear it. Had to take it to an apple store to uninstall the upgrade and use there version to correct the problem. In long story short. The apple computer is great as long you DO NOT UPGRADE IT from an non apple store
SPAM,3.0,All I can say its a great laptop except that my husband complains that it was slow.
HAM,3.0,Upgraded from an old Macbook which was maxed out with 2Gigs of memory,so this Macbook Pro is much more responsive and fast in comparison. I love it,except for the one *stupid* decision by Apple to cripple the audio jack on this specific model (mid-2012 13
HAM,3.0,I was an avid Mac guy. Until I purchased this product and realized all the things they took off of the initial software. That you now have to purchase. For ex. (iPhoto,GarageBand). It

HAM,3.0,not that easy to use. win8 is not user friendly. or i am too used to apple.
HAM,3.0,It only stayed with me for one day before I returned it to local store. Pretty disappointed for its design. First of all,it does not look fashion,not as expected for an Apple product. It is thick and heavy,heavier than you expected for a 13.3inch laptop.
HAM,3.0,Great laptop,fast and easy to download files and organize tasks/projects.
HAM,3.0,This is a good product that gets the job done for me. A little pricier than expected.
HAM,3.0,Good computer home use but not practical for travelers
HAM,3.0,Well what can I say..... it an Apple. Yes,the graphics are good,the operating system is simple and overall not a bad computer at all. However,I would still prefer Windows.
HAM,3.0,It is good for editing simple things,but when you try to do jobs that require more video capability,reduces his performance,during multitasking gets slow,takes too long to do video conversions and tends to overheat when running heavy programs like games and when you edit with HD videos. Apple is not the same as before,has greatly reduced its capacity.
The display its no HD.
HAM,3.0,This was my attempt to move from the PC to MAC world. Unfortunately,that didn
HAM,3.0,My first MAC experience. Easy to use and learn. Really like the keyboard with the backlight for the keys.

HAM,3.0,So where do I begin so that the legions of Apple critics and fans do not view this as support of their narrow views? I will say that I am not into the Windows vs. iOS argument - I do not think Apple is evil nor that they have,hands downs,the best products. I have had Windows desktops and one laptop - and yes - I had the typical problems with them that are often used as reasons for one moving on to Apple. I had said that my next notebook would be an Apple,but never really wanted to pay Apple
HAM,4.0,This is my first Mac purchase. Every other laptop I have purchased had to be replaced or repaired about every two to three years. I was tired of throwing my money away. I finally decided to spend the extra money and invest in a Mac. It
HAM,4.0,Definitely a good buy,except that a discount of a few hundred dollars would help.
HAM,4.0,I would definitely recommend. It does take some time to figure out how to use the Mac. I am still figuring things out! But in the end it is worth it.
HAM,4.0,The product is good

HAM,4.0,Excellent highly recommended to any computer user. Only laptop I will ever purchase again.

HAM,4.0,I would recommend this computer to anyone for a home computer. Has a CD-ROM drive. Runs fast
HAM,4.0,Switched from PC to MAC. Learning curve is easy. Computer is fast.
HAM,4.0,technology 2nd to none. our children are able to use and navigate through the mac.
HAM,4.0,My first Mac Book pro was old and big. I was looking to upgrade. I looked at the competition and yes they are less in price but I loved my old one. So I stuck with I knew and loved.
HAM,4.0,Love it glad I didn
HAM,4.0,I am still trying to figure out the Mac. It works nicely. Glad I purchased this product.
HAM,4.0,Awesome laptop that easy to use. It is the best thing since sliced bread!
HAM,4.0,Technically its a good computer,enough power for daily routines and maybe running some programs on it such as Adobe Suite. It is not for people who require massive power for playing games,or editing videos or even 3D modeling. The big plus is that your can upgrade the RAM and HDD as you see fit down the line; the newer retina display models won
HAM,4.0,I like it just wish

HAM,4.0,This is my first macbook pro. It is a good first apple computer to start with. The look of the laptop is nice and the light up keyboard is really nice.
HAM,4.0,After using Windows XP for a number of years I find it a little difficult to get up to speed with using a new operating system. My daughters recommended the MacBook Pro instead of the new Windows 8 and so far I haven

HAM,4.0,We really enjoy the macbook. It is very user friendly and meets all of our needs. We only wish that we got one with a larger screen.

HAM,4.0,This has a CD/DVD drive and a hard drive,so of course weighs more than a McBookAir... so that is the trade-off; if you don
HAM,4.0,I bought this computer for two main reasons. 1. I needed a computer that I could take to class,study groups,the coffee shop,etc. and not need to worry about charging it. 2. I wanted to use the programs I was trained with in school,such as I Movie and Garage Band. For me,it has fulfilled both of these functions perfectly. It is a lot of money for what it is,but thankfully I managed to buy it during a sale! A pleasant surprise for me was amount of free apps in the Apple store. If you buy this computer,I highly recommend looking through them! Thank you for reading this review and enjoy your shopping!
HAM,4.0,For me,it came down to the cost vs. the quality. If you love your other Apple products,which I do,it is probably worth it. However,I am still getting used to the Office-less work production.
HAM,4.0,I am a die-hard PC user,but I have loved what the MacBook Pro can do with video and pictures. It takes a bit of retraining to use a Mac,but the rewards are worth it. My MacBook Pro has an amazing battery life,(well exceeding 9 hours),but the load hasn
HAM,4.0,Purchased item for student for more security against computer viruses since attack on last computer. I am a windows person so I had no idea what to expect. The set up was pretty easy and my child seems to love it since it links everything between the iPhone and the MacBook. I

HAM,4.0,Im glad I got one,its a good investment and is going to simplify my work.
HAM,4.0,The MacBook Pro computers are all engineered in outstanding fashion and this one is no exception. It may lack some of the most up to date features of the new Macs,but it really doesn
HAM,4.0,I would recommend anyone getting a mac. I ablsolutely love it. My phone was not working recently so it was great being able to call my friends using my mac book pro
HAM,4.0,Happy I moved from pc to Mac. The MacBook is a great machine!
HAM,4.0,This is my first mac. I must admit it is as as everyone says
HAM,4.0,This product is excellent. My bro loves it. It is not easily broken and user friendly.
HAM,4.0,I am so happy we have decided on all MAC books for our business. Never will go back to PCs.
HAM,4.0,My first computer was a Macintosh back in 1989,so I cut my teeth of Apple products. Apple has (almost) always delivered the highest quality,and most aesthetically-pleasing computer products on the planet. The Macbook Pro is no exception. If I had to make one negative comment,I find the price point a bit high for the product. There are several quality laptops on the market for several hundred dollars less. It comes down to whether or not someone feels the Apple brand and operating system (slick,I must admit) is worth the extra cash.
HAM,4.0,This computer is used in his school and he will be able to use this through high school and beyond,
HAM,4.0,I bought this mac book for my son (Chritmas gift) to do the Home work. Easy to setup and installed the office 2010 and works great,
So far no issues.
HAM,4.0,I love the computer so far and am still trying to figure out all it can do. I just need some tips for easy tips and tricks. I love it more than my HP I had previously.
HAM,4.0,I would recommend this product if you can find a good sale price to get it at. Be careful as it gets dirty easily - especially the screen. Great for photo editing,playing music and movies.
HAM,4.0,Great product. I have great expectations because it is an Apple product. It will take time using the product to see if it is as good as I believe it should be.
HAM,4.0,It has a great display and is very fast and if you buy the Microsoft word it is very school friendly but DVD player on mine tends to work when it wants to
HAM,4.0,Great overall product that will last forever. A little pricey but overall worth the buy
HAM,4.0,This is a MAC that is good for a starter. I would suggest to others.
HAM,4.0,Good reliable apple product. The specifications of this moderate end model is good for my normal use.
HAM,4.0,I bought this as a gift during Black Friday.
HAM,4.0,I appreciate the style and how it works. I like everything about it.
HAM,4.0,Love it cause it goes with all my other apple products
HAM,4.0,My son is in graphic design,so this was the way to go. He is excited to have it,so it was worth the extra dough....... Now,hopefully,he can find a job to use the thing.....
HAM,4.0,this is a good product with fast high speed capability. It is very intuative and easy to use. The only frustration I have with it is the adaptability to be able to transfer files such as pics from an external hard drive.
HAM,4.0,Bought the item as an open box product for $100 less than the sale price only issue was the charger that was in the box was the wrong one. Took the item back to the store and they replaced it with the correct charger.
HAM,4.0,This is a great laptop to own. Long battery life,just heavy and hard to get used to the weight of it.
HAM,4.0,Great apple product as always does the. Job. Enjoy the sound and compact size.
HAM,4.0,This is a good choice for beginners to start with.I purchased this for my Xcode programming and initially I had difficulty with bringing up the iOS simulator later I understood that it is the problem with the ram. Now I own MBP Retina 13-inch 2013 late edition with 8 gb RAM and 256 GB SSD.
HAM,4.0,Love the Mac intuitive apps and products. Very easy to use and fast.
HAM,4.0,This is my first MAC. I am satisfied with the quality of the computer,but it is definitely different than the HP I previously used. Before I bought my MAC,I heard how easy it was to use,but to me it is more difficult in many ways. Also,because I switched,I had to purchase programs to view existing home videos. For someone buying their first computer,it is probably the way to go. But for someone who previously owned another brand,be aware that the MAC is different and will take some getting used to.
HAM,4.0,I really enjoy my computer. It is nice that Mac computers rarely,if ever get viruses. The battery life is good and so is the computer set-up. I found the computer easy to run. One thing I dislike about Mac computers is that you need adapters for everything. If you want to connect to an ethernet cord,you need a certain adapter that cost $20-30 more. This is true for hooking the computer to the TV. Overall,I think the product is durable and a good product to have.
HAM,4.0,This was a great replacement to my other Mac. I liked how wasy it was to connect to my other Apple products and how easy it was to set up. Compared to my PC connecting it to the internet and transferring files the Mac was much easier.
HAM,4.0,This is my first Mac it is easy to use and high in quality.
HAM,4.0,I really like my new Macbook Pro. It
HAM,4.0,Great product for students and business professionals

HAM,4.0,I would rec this pc to anyone thats just starting out with apple. But i would also rec that you wait for the specials to come out.This pc
HAM,4.0,I have given up on windows machines. I love my MAC. Still trying to get used to it but find it easy to switch too.

HAM,4.0,This is a great computer to start out with to learn the mac system. Have used the customer support service,staff was very helpful and knew their product well!
HAM,4.0,second macbook I have owned. the long term value is why I like this product. My 4 year old macbook ran just like the day I bought it.. I like the new case that the mac book has…much better than the plastic.
HAM,4.0,I used this for personal use. I do all my computer needs here and I can be sure it will be safe. It is durable and lightweight. My only concern is the picture is only small. I guess I should have bought a bigger one,but then if I did that,then it will be heavier....aside from that,no complaints!
HAM,4.0,Extremely great device that works extremely well my mom loves it her first mac
HAM,4.0,Easy to use and fast. I like it very cozy. It

HAM,4.0,Really nice build quality,easy to use. My only gripe is that it doesn
HAM,4.0,I really like the Macbook Pro 13. It is the perfect balance of size,performance and value. You could spend significantly more and get the retina display for a better screen. If you need a lighter computer you could get the Macbook Air but you would have as much storage space and RAM. This was the best compromise for me and my situation. I use this at home as my primary computer but I don
HAM,4.0,Set up was a breeze! The Mac Book Pro easily 
HAM,4.0,After using iPad2 for sometime i started liking the Apple products and thought I would chnage my personal desktop to apple products. This is easy to use,having better security,predicatble performance and wonderful apps..I Like it.
HAM,4.0,Great tool for a HS daughter to use. She uses it for Homework.
HAM,4.0,I decided to purchase a macbook pro for college since my old laptop crash. The best purchase I have ever made,it is way better than windows pc. I would definitely purchase a mac soon. The only downside is it is really expensive.
HAM,4.0,we intend to make this one last awhile. it looks like it should,
HAM,4.0,it is what my daughter wanted,so i got it. and she enjoys it.
HAM,4.0,Great entry level Mac Labtop. Lightweight and easy to use. Better battery life than my PC Labtop

HAM,4.0,This computer is good at doing things that other computers and laptops do. Its also not very hard to use.

HAM,4.0,I wud recoment dis to my fren cuz its a frenly user.. And alot of things are able to use it in my skul.
HAM,4.0,Love this computer. Bought one for my wife and daughter after going through several PC laptops. The Apple MacBook has performed well over the past two years. No issues and runs like a champ. Bought a third for my son. Will buy nothing but Apple in the future.
HAM,4.0,Honestly from the first time I powered up this machine i fell in love. The operating system is smooth and seamless. I sometimes have intermittent connectivity issues with WIFI rumour has it that mac are very temperamental when it comes to the router being used. Other wise a great performing machine with great battery life. WIFI issues aside I
HAM,4.0,I am a student on a limited budget so I did a lot of research before deciding to buy a Mac. I knew I wanted a Macbook but was not sure whether the Pro or Air would be better. I talked to representatives at my local Apple store several times to see what would be best for me. I knew that for me to spend so much money on a laptop,the laptop would have to be excellent. Overall,I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. I didn
HAM,4.0,My son wanted a mac for school. He is loving it. Small,easy to transport and use in class. He is happy with the speed and capabilities and battery life so far.
SPAM,4.0,Completely different experience from a windows user. Seems harder to navigate and everything is smaller. I get frustrated a few times from not knowing where to go and what to do next even on a simple task. I have to invest a lot of time to learn it. On the positive side. it feels like a solid machine,and well constructed. I will stick to it and get use to OS X.
HAM,4.0,great price and size for a college student...simple to set up!
HAM,4.0,Nothing bad to say. Gift for college student as she loves it
HAM,4.0,Macbook works great. Sometimes has trouble switching back and forth between programs and takes a bit to load some screens. Bought with college student discounts which helped a lot.
HAM,4.0,I have always used windows and was not sure i could get used to a Mac. I was wrong,it was easy to convert
HAM,4.0,Bought for my Daughter to use at college. She is used to the operating systems on Apple products so this was a natural choice for her. She loves it and it will do everything she needs it to do for the next 4 years.
HAM,4.0,Great laptop,no issues so far but everyone knows you pay for the name not the software. Easy to learn though.
HAM,4.0,Apple continues to outperform competition in all areas except for pricing. But the pros still outweigh the cons.
HAM,4.0,Good product and features. Easy to set up and use. Great network and support products and systems in place and available.
SPAM,4.0,It has the usual advantage of being a Mac. User friendly,etc.Biggest drawback (for me): No capability for concurrent audio in/out. The one jack has to be designated for use as an input or output. I hope to work around this with an adapter to use a usb port for audio input,while maintaining the 1/8 jack as the output. To be determined whether they will work concurrently. This is not likely a concern for most users,so take it for what it is worth.
HAM,4.0,Typical Apple perfection. As with most Apple products,simple to set up and use.
HAM,4.0,Great product,I love i. I use it for school,searching the web,paying bills,music. I did buy a mouse pad for it just to make it easier to use and to keep key board clean and not ruin buttons with my hard typing. Only bad thing was the price and very costly. Hopefully it will last a very long time.
HAM,4.0,All in all this is a great computer. I switched from a PC to a Mac and was very nervous about the making the transition. However,as with all Apple products,the computer is very intuitive and it is easy to learn the new procedures and processes. I love it!
SPAM,4.0,The battery life is all right but not all that great
SPAM,4.0,I loved almost everything about my mac! i wish the plug was not so big. it kept falling out of the outlet in the wall. it 
SPAM,4.0,wish I had something I could read to learn all the wonderful things this will do
SPAM,4.0,I have always been a PC person and was looking for a small laptop to travel with. I have a netbook but do not like the odd screen resolution and feel its a bit under powered. I was considering an 11 inch model but figured that a 13 inch would be small enough to travel with and would have enough power to use for other things.
SPAM,4.0,Macintosh computers are always going to be more expensive. you pay for the name. Believe me,these same specs,or better even,can be had on a PC for literally $1000.00 less. I purchased this for school,because the user interface on Mac is so amazing. The ability to quickly scroll through screens,and multi touch gestures are an amenity that I needed.
SPAM,4.0,Well I wish I could afford Mac Air with more storage but I could not ,so bought this one. Its bit heavier than I wanted and did not have a Matte screen,Apple need to bring Matte screens. Otherwise really nice laptop works well. Will be upgrading the Memory myself to make it even better.
HAM,5.0,I was in the market for a new laptop and was going back and forth between a Mac book pro and a windows based laptop. After much deliberation I settled on the the Mac book despite the additional expense. So far I have enjoyed it tremendously ! It does not have the same old windows hang ups that we all know about and the processor speed is impressive !
I use it for a combination of business and personal use so I ended up buying the word for Mac. No problems,basically the same thing as a PC with a few changes here and there.
HAM,5.0,I have been a PC user my whole life and this Mac just changed me for good. All my music programs downloaded with ease and makes navigating around so easy. I am now looking for a Mac desktop next

HAM,5.0,This is an excellent laptop. I wish I would have bought this laptop years ago. The price is not so great,but think about it. This laptop is made to last for more years than a pc laptop. The operating system is great. The macbook pro is a little heavy,but it is all aluminum,which makes it durable. I like the touch pad as well. You can customize the touchpad to do what you want it to do. The battery life is great also. I took it to a class and for four hours the battery lasted easily. Love this computer

HAM,5.0,The Apple MacBook Pro is amazing!

HAM,5.0,I would recomend this along with all apple products!!
HAM,5.0,I purchased the Mac book to replace a 6 year old Dell which served me vey well. When I went through the selection process,I was looking for a laptop that was lighter weight and improved speed. I was not impressed with the look and feel of W8 and I wanted a laptop with an internal DVD,which most of the new Ultra-Books were missing. The Mac OS has taken a little while to get used to,but so far I am very happy with my new Mac Book Pro
HAM,5.0,The Macbook Pro is simply a fantastic machine. The build quality is superior. The Macbook Pro is a great machine for any user because it never quits on you. The performance is amazing as you can pretty much do anything you want it too. The Macbook Pro is also one of the only machines left in the Mac line with a CD drive built in. This being said,this machine is great for music enthusiasts. I highly recommend,once you go mac you don

HAM,5.0,I use my Mac everyday. Primarily for business but also use it for personal use as well.

HAM,5.0,We are cery happy with our purchase. It helps my daughter get through her homework in a timely fashion.
HAM,5.0,Speed is good and the ease of using this computer is great.
HAM,5.0,This MacBook Pro comes ready to use right outside the box. It is also easier to understand than Windows 7. It is a beautiful laptop. It has has a quiet backlit keyboard,beautiful screen and it is very lightweight. I was trying to decide between a laptop and an iPad and for me this wins hands down. This is the last of the apple products that still includes the cd drive as well which is why I went with this model and not the newer one. Although it is pricey,it is worth the extra money for a better longer lasting laptop.
HAM,5.0,I love this laptop! Apple products are great. They are so well designed and they work so flawlessly with one another. I use the laptop for video editing,music editing,projection and document production. Great machine!

HAM,5.0,Perfect. Designed beautifully. Fast and great for business or personal use
SPAM,5.0,Great computer for the price,a larger screen would be cool but not worth the extra original price.
HAM,5.0,when our old laptop at last retired,decided to give the mac a try - we love it!
HAM,5.0,Upgraded from a 4 year old MacBook. Now I can work seamlessly with my iPad and iPhone,the screen is great,nice having a SD card slot,too. I
HAM,5.0,This laptop is the best Mac has to offer. I would recommend it to any power user who needs the the flexibility of a mobile option.
HAM,5.0,The Macbook Pro is a great laptop for beginners or experienced users as well. Proven reliability,performance and overall great value. The perfect match with my iPhone and iPad Air. The retina display model in my opinion is over rated and over priced! This is a great machine with a lot of advantages for the price.
SPAM,5.0,Mac book will always cost an are and a leg but you can buy a Samsung for way less and almost do the exact things.

HAM,5.0,I purchased this Macbook Pro primarily for work and school. Full time grad student and teacher and this computer is easy to navigate. I already own an iPad,iPhone,and iPod and this just completed my collection. I traded my Sony Music computer in for this because I needed a quicker operating system and simplicity. No need to read manuals,or search for stuff to make your items compatible. I would recommend putting a case on it because the surface does scratch easily. They have great colors in store to go with your macbook. Worth every penny!
HAM,5.0,My grandson will use it for school. He will start taking computer technology. He said Mac Book Pro is the best.
HAM,5.0,For most of my life,I
HAM,5.0,This is my first Mac book and I love it. Very easy to use and I love how it syncs right with my phone. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a computer that is not into gaming and just trying to get work done along with internet entertainment.

HAM,5.0,I love the lap top and I love the fact that it is so easy to use.
HAM,5.0,Bought my daughter one for grad. She loves it! Wish I had bought one for myself sooner!!
HAM,5.0,We have two of these laptops,one with 4G RAM and a 500G hard-drive and one with 8G RAM and 750G hard-drive. They work well,all the time. We have a home network and mostly Windows laptops,one Ubuntu,printer,etc,and these laptops were easy to set up and establish on the network. They interface with everything on our network seamlessly with very little work on our part. They do anything we need them to do,when we need them to. A product that works like is is supposed to is worth the extra $$$.
HAM,5.0,Great for an apple beginner light weight and easy to carry around all day
HAM,5.0,Nice to be able to connect all of my apple products with little difficulties.
HAM,5.0,Excellent product I would recommend it highly so intuitive to use

HAM,5.0,I have had windows PC a and this is beyond the ease of use with a quick setup. No need to update anything just plug and play.
HAM,5.0,Absolutely in LOVE with my new Apple MacBook. It is SO fast,easty to carry around and so easy to navigate. It is worth every penny spent. I will definitely stick with Apple. Picks up Wifi in places that my other devices dont. Great experience!
HAM,5.0,My new MacBook pro is so much faster than my old Dell.
HAM,5.0,Good performance,good speed,good of everything,Im use to hate mac products but really if they made my life easer I will buy their products.

HAM,5.0,Always have good luck with apple products. This one is the same love it
HAM,5.0,THE BEST COMPUTER ON THE MARKET. HAD TWO SONY VAIO AND HAD TWO GATEWAY LAPTOPS AND THEY DIDNT LAST FOR ANYTHING. I NOW HAVE TWO MAC BOOKS TWO IPADS AND NUMEROUS OTHER APPLE PRODUCTS. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING OTHER THAN APPLE PRODUCT AGAIN. THE STAFF WERE REAL KNOWLEGABLE ALSO.
HAM,5.0,Apple always produces great products that are easy to use.
HAM,5.0,Apple makes great products,and this is no exception. We bought this for my daughter to take to college,and she picked this model because she wanted the integral optical drive.
HAM,5.0,I chose this model as the hard drive and memory are user upgradable. I upgraded the memory to 8GB and put the 1TB drive from my 6-year old Macbook in the new one and it came up without any issues. No drivers to find,it just worked. Try that on a Windows machine. I now have my files and programs without having to reinstall and restore. The sound quality is acceptable but I usually use an external bluetooth speaker anyway. Even though this is not the super-high resolution retina version,the resolution is still quite nice. The addition of USB 3.0 ports is a wonderful addition,my very slow and old 32GB thumb drive flies when connected to the USB on this laptop,and yet,it
HAM,5.0,Love Macs but they can be pricey. This is a good basic Mac. Value is better for this one than the more expensive one.

HAM,5.0,For a teenage student,the MacBook Pro is so much better then the traditional PC. Using the MacBook Pro is intuitive and it works right out of the box. Being so fast and easy,it makes school work a breeze. The performance,size and reliability really lets you enjoy doing school work. Worth the investment.
HAM,5.0,great device. absolutely fantastic. Great for editing music 
HAM,5.0,Bought this machine for my wife to do her work related stuff,small learning curve but it beats our windows 8 desktop for reliability hands down. Battery life is great. I bought a similar one for my son to take to college 2 years ago he has had zero issues with his,he has dropped it into the wall and onto tile floor it only hurt the wall.
HAM,5.0,I think the Mac Book Pro was worth the money. I think the overall quality of the computer is better then the others I had looked at. I also feel more at ease knowing that I don 
HAM,5.0,A very good small computer. Easy to use. I am new to Mac but found this easy and fun.
HAM,5.0,In looking for a new laptop I did not want a new Windows 8 unit as I do not find it
